### Course Description

An introductory course on applied statistics. The course provides a hands-on approach to understanding, quantification and decision-making under various forms of uncertainty. The main topics include visualization of uncertainty, probabilistic quantification of uncertainty, Bayesian and non-Bayesian ways of decision-making under uncertainty. Class activities incorporate active learning elements, including in-class computation with professional-grade software for statistical analysis and simulation.

---

### Course Format

The course is offered during August 25, 2022 through December 11, 2022. Every week, there are in-class lectures on Monday and Wednesday. There is also a lab on Friday, which aims to give you hands-on experience with data analysis using the R statistical language. Lecture notes and lab materials will be available on Canvas.

### Grading

Grades will be calculated as follows:

* Homework assignments: 30%
* Midterm exam: 30%
* Final project: 40%

The final letter grades will follow the usual scale: A=90-100; B=80-89; C=70-79; D=60-69; F=0-59. Plus and minus grades will be given at discretion of the instructor.

### Homework

There will be approximately 6 homework assignments that will be posted on Canvas. Solutions must be uploaded to Canvas as a __PDF__ file. Please make sure your work is clearly presented. Assignments are due at the beginning of class hour on the specified date. In general, __NO__ late submissions will be accepted. In case of truly exceptional situations (e.g., family emergencies or illness), the instructor may make exceptions and allow late submission. The lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester. 

### Midterm Exam

There will be an in-class midterm exam on __October 3, 2022__. The exam will be closed-book. Each student should work on the exam independently.

### Final Project

There will be a final project due on __December 12, 2022__, where you will apply the methods you learn from the course to analyze a dataset. More details about the final project will be posted and discussed later in the semester.
