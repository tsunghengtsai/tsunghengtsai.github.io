### Course Objectives

Computation plays an essential role in modern statistics and machine learning. This course aims to develop a broad working knowledge of modern computational statistics. The topics include tools for exploratory data analysis, simulation, computational techniques for optimization, numerical integration, statistical modeling, statistical inference, and statistical prediction.

The course will use the programming language R. In many cases the course will rely on the existing implementations of statistical methods, but some programming effort will also be required.

After successful completion of the course, the students will understand the underlying principles of modern computational methods used in statistics, and be able to (1) use computational techniques to organize, explore, summarize, and analyze data, (2) use computation as a tool to investigate the properties of statistical methods, and (3) appropriately apply and/or develop computational methods to solve statistical problems.

### Course operation

Each week, there will be lectures on Monday and Wednesday, and an in-class lab on Friday. The instructor will be available in the lab session for help. Unless otherwise noted, the lab will be due 11:59PM on Sunday (the end of the week). Attendance to labs is optional, but highly encouraged. There will also be an in-class midterm exam (on Wednesday Oct 9), and a final take-home exam (assigned on Friday Dec 6).


---

### Grading

Grades will be calculated as follows:

* Labs: 60%
* Midterm exam: 20%
* Final exam: 20%

The final letter grades will follow the usual scale:

* 90-100 = A-range (i.e., A+, A or A-)
* 80-89 = B-range (i.e., B+, B or B-)
* 70-79 = C-range (i.e., C+, C or C-)
* 60-69 = D
* 0-59 = F

The cutoffs for "+" and "-" will be determined at the end of the semester, at the discretion of the intructor. This scale is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor

### Labs

Each lab will consist of a set of hands-on exercises, and will be completed in R Markdown format (with Rmd extension). An Rmd file contains a combination of content with simple text and R code chunks. Labs will be turned in through Blackboard, due 11:59pm on Sunday (the end of the week). Each lab must be submitted as an R Markdown source file and the resulting PDF output (generated by calling "Knit to PDF"). 

Students may choose to discuss and collaborate with friends on the labs, but your submitted work must be your own. Sharing of solutions will not be tolerated and will be considered cheating.

No late work will be accepted. Extensions may be given individually if requested at least 48 hours in advance of the due date with a reasonable justification. The two lowest lab scores of the semester will be dropped.

### Exams

One in-class midterm exam, and one take-home final exam. No collaboration with peers is allowed.
