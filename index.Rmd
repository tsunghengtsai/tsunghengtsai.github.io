I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), working with Professor Olga Vitek. My current research is focused on the development of statistical and computational methods for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Prior to the current position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I developed genomic chemopredictors for breast cancer prognosis and response to treatment. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2014.
