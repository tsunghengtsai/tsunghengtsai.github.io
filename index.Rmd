I am a postdoctoral research associate in the College of Science and College of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University, working with Professor Olga Vitek. My current research is focused on the development of statistical and computational methods for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Prior to the current position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at MD Anderson Cancer Center, where I developed genomic chemopredictors for breast cancer prognosis and response to treatment. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech in 2014.
