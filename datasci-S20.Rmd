### Course Objectives

This course offers a gentle introduction to the field of data science. The goal of this course is to teach students how to answer questions with data. We will cover topics of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and modeling, and statistical learning. We will also teach the necessary skills to gather, organize, explore and analyze data, and to develop data products to facilitate effective communication and reproducible research. The programming language R will be used extensively. The course will rely on the existing implementations of statistical methods in many cases, but some programming efforts will also be required.

### Grading

Grades will be calculated as follows:

* 6 homeworks: 30% (the lowest grade dropped)
* Midterm exam: 30%
* Final project: 40%

The final letter grades will follow the usual scale:

* 90--100 = A-range (i.e., A or A-)
* 80--89 = B-range (i.e., B+, B or B-)
* 70--79 = C-range (i.e., C+, C or C-)
* 60--69 = D
* 0--59 = F

The cutoffs for "+" and "-" will be determined at the end of the semester, at the discretion of the instructor. This scale is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor

### Homework

There will be six homework assignments. Each homework is due before class on the day it is listed, and should be completed in R Markdown format (with Rmd extension). An Rmd file contains a combination of content with simple text and R code chunks. Both the R Markdown source file and the resulting PDF output (generated by calling "Knit to PDF") must be turned in through Blackboard. 

Students may discuss and collaborate with friends, but your submitted work must be your own. Sharing of solutions will not be tolerated and will be considered cheating.

No late work will be accepted. Extensions may be given individually if requested at least 48 hours in advance of the due date with a reasonable justification. The lowest homework grade will be dropped.

### Exam

There will be an in-class midterm exam that counts for 30% of your grade. No collaboration with peers is allowed.

### Final project

There will be a final project that counts for 40% of your grade. More details will be posted and discussed later in the semester.
