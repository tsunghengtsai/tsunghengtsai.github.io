### Course Description

An introductory course on applied statistics. The course provides a hands-on approach to understanding, quantification and decision-making under various forms of uncertainty. The main topics include visualization of uncertainty, probabilistic quantification of uncertainty, Bayesian and non-Bayesian ways of decision-making under uncertainty. Class activities incorporate active learning elements, including in-class computation with professional-grade software for statistical analysis and simulation.

---

### Course Format

The course is offered remotely during August 26, 2021 through December 12, 2021. Every week, there are recorded video lectures for classes on Monday and Wednesday. The videos and notes will be available on Blackboard. The instructor will hold online meetings through Blackboard Collaborate Ultra at class hours, to answer questions and/or discuss extra examples. There is also a lab on Friday, which aims to give you hands-on experience with data analysis using the R statistical language.

### Grading

Grades will be calculated as follows:

* Homework assignments: 70%
* Final project: 30%

The final letter grades will follow the usual scale: A=90-100; B=80-89; C=70-79; D=60-69; F=0-59. Plus and minus grades will be given at discretion of the instructor.

### Homework

There will be approximately 8 homework assignments that will be posted on Blackboard. Solutions must be uploaded to Blackboard as a __PDF__ file. Please make sure your work is clearly presented. Assignments are due at the beginning of class hour on the specified date. In general, __NO__ late submissions will be accepted. In case of truly exceptional situations (e.g., family emergencies or illness), the instructor may make exceptions and allow late submission. The lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester. 

### Final Project

There will be a final project, where you will apply the methods you learn from the course to analyze a dataset. More details about the final project will be posted and discussed later in the semester.
