### Course Description

This is the second course of the two-semester Mathematical Statistics sequence, which covers the essential mathematics for work in statistics, the mathematical methods for statistical inference, and the approaches for evaluating the efficacy of inferential procedures. Topics of this course include: point estimation, hypothesis testing, interval estimation, and asymptotic evaluations.

### Grading

Grades will be calculated as follows:

* Homework assignments: 20%
* Midterm exam 1: 20% (Thursday February 24) 
* Midterm exam 2: 20% (Thursday March 24) 
* Final exam: 40% (Thursday May 5) 

The final letter grades will follow the usual scale: A=90-100; B=80-89; C=70-79; D=60-69; F=0-59. Plus and minus grades will be given at discretion of the instructor.

### Homework

There will be approximately 6 homework assignments that will be posted on Blackboard. Assignments must be uploaded to Blackboard as a PDF file. You can either type your homework solutions or write them on papers and upload the scanned version. In any case, please make sure your work is clearly presented.

Assignments are due at the beginning of class hour on the specified date. In general, no late submissions will be accepted. In case of truly exceptional situations (e.g., family emergencies or illness), the instructor may make exceptions and allow late submission. The lowest homework score will be dropped at the end of the semester. 

### Exam

There will be three in-class exams: two midterm exams and one comprehensive final exam (dates mentioned above). The exams are closed-book. Each student should work on the exams independently.
